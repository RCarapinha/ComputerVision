# ComputerVision

Work done in Computer Vision in 4th year of Masters passed in Poland.

# Laboratory 1

Exercise 1: Load, Show, Histogram, Grayscale and Histogram Equalization
Exercise 2: Increase Brightness
Exercise 3: Rotate and Resize
Exercise 4: Threshold by Otsu Method
Exercise 5: Crop Image
Exercise 6: Cross-Correlation
Exercise 7: Sobel and Canny Filters

# Laboratory 2

Several ways to compress images, each one with their own advantages and disadvantages.

These algorithms usually work by eliminating the redundancy, saying/coding the same information in less space/words. The algorithms shown are lossless, this means that there isn't information lost in the process of compression.

There are also compression algorithms that are lossy, that means that some information is lost during the compression. These algorithms can be good if we are more interested in the data compression than in the data itself but for pictures these algorithms will make the pictures lose detail.

# Laboratory 3

Filters and what are the effect of them in the images. When applying the filters to images we can remove the noise of it but depending on what filter we use, we can also affect good parts of the image.

Filters are important to recover old/damaged pictures and to improve certain parts of the images.

# Laboratory 5

Deep Learning Approach in MATLAB.

# Project

My project is Face Recognition and Comparison, the goal of the project is for the camera to recognize the faces and compare it when other faces. The program can take pictures of the face and then we can compare the face with another images with a certain degree of certainty
